## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I wanted to clearly state the source of the intro image. After thinking about what to do, I wanted to make it possible to click on an image to display credits, and to create a VISIT button on the right side to actually visit the original post. I implemented this through Snackbar.
